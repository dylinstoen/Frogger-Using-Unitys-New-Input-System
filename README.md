# Tutorial
A. for a 99% complete version, put the files "Frogger.cs, PlayerControls.cs, PlayerControls.inputactions, GameManager.cs, and Home.cs" inside your project. It includes every peice of code up until 2:18:27. You'll have to manually add the "IEnumerator PlayAgain()" function inside GameManager.cs as I didn't need to add it for what I was doing but you should be able to add it directly from the video without any modifications and it should work.
B. for a bare minimum version put the files "Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs, PlayerControls.cs, and PlayerControls.inputactions" inside your project. It includes every peice of code up until 0:51:32. This should get you past the frogger movement section which is the hardest part when it comes to implementing the new input system. To get started you just need to attach the "Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs" script to a gameobject with a "SpriteRenderer" component attached and you should be able to move around like in the tutorial.
