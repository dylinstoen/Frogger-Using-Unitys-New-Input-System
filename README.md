# Convert this [Frogger tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxlxZ5q__Tc&t) code to use Unitys new Input System

## Bare Minimum Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Bare Minimum Setup" folder for a bare minimum version, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`

This is a 10% completed version of Frogger. It provides every piece of code needed up until [0:51:32](https://youtu.be/GxlxZ5q__Tc?si=IwRe5YcFsOCC25dQ&t=3082) in the tutorial, covering the frogger movement section. Takes little to no manual setup just drag and drop and it should work.

## Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup" folder for a nearly complete version, include the following files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`
- `MoveCycle.cs` or `MoveCycle (Odin Serializer).cs` if you have the `Odin Serializer` add-on installed

This is a 90% completed version of Frogger. It provides every piece of code needed up until [2:18:27](https://youtu.be/GxlxZ5q__Tc?si=k-xLhMrlN-F8yW6h&t=8307) in the tutorial. Takes a little manual setup but nothing outside the tutorial.

## Beyond the Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Beyond the Tutorial Setup" folder for a version which seperates the input and logic into seperate scripts, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`
- `InputManager.cs`
- `MoveCycle.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `StatsGUIStyle.uss`
- `StatsGUIVisualTree.uxml`
- `PanelSettings.asset`
- `8-bit Arcade In.ttf`
- `MoveCycle.cs` or `MoveCycle (Odin Serializer).cs` if you have the `Odin Serializer` add-on installed

This is an almost 100% completed version of Frogger, I still need to add the EndGame Gui but thats it. I also spent a little time outside of the tutorial refactoring the code so this one will be a little more challenging to setup then the others. It also uses the `UI Toolkit` add-on and it will require some knoweledge on how to set up a basic canvas using `UI Toolkit`.

Finally, I included some refrence photos so you can see how these scripts come together. If you need any help setting it up let me know either through email, through Zigurous's discord server which can be found linked on his Youtube channel (im TurboThunder20 on there), or shoot me a private dm on discord and ill make sure to respond as quick as I can. username: turbothunder20 name: TurboThunder20

Shoutout to Zigurous for the awesome tutorial
