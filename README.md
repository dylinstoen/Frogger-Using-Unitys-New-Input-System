# Tutorial

- A. for a 99% complete version, put the files
  - "Frogger.cs, PlayerControls.cs, PlayerControls.inputactions, GameManager.cs, Home.cs" inside your project.

This is every peice of code needed up until 2:18:27. You'll have to add the "IEnumerator PlayAgain()" function manually.

- B. for a bare minimum version put the files
  - "Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs, PlayerControls.cs, PlayerControls.inputactions" inside your project.

This is every peice of code needed up until 0:51:32. This should get you past the frogger movement section which is the hardest part when it comes to implementing the new input system.
