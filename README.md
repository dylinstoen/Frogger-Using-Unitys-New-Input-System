# Tutorial

## Bare Minimum Version

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Bare Minimum Tutorial Setup" folder for a bare minimum version, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`

This provides every piece of code needed up until 0:51:32 in the tutorial, covering the frogger movement section.


## 99% Complete Version

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup" folder for a nearly complete version, include the following files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`

This provides every piece of code needed up until 2:18:27 in the tutorial.

## Beyond the Tutorial

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Beyond The Tutorial Setup" folder for a version that has stuff beyond the tutorial, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`

This is a completed version of Frogger but I spent extra time refactoring the code seperating the input from the logic itself.
