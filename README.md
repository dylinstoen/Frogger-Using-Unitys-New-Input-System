# Tutorial

## Bare Minimum Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Bare Minimum Setup" folder for a bare minimum version, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`

This provides every piece of code needed up until 0:51:32 in the tutorial, covering the frogger movement section.


## Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup" folder for a nearly complete version, include the following files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`

This provides every piece of code needed up until 2:18:27 in the tutorial.

## Beyond the Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Beyond the Tutorial Setup" folder for a version which cleans up tutorial scripts seperating the logic in seperate sceipts, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`
- `InputManager.cs`
- `MoveCycle.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `StatsGUIStyle.uss`
- `StatsGUIVisualTree.uxml`
- `PanelSettings.asset`
- `8-bit Arcade In.ttf`

This is a 100% completed version of Frogger but I spent a little extra time refactoring the code. To get it working you need to install 
- `UI Toolkit`
-
