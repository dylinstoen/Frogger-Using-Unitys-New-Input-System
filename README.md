# Tutorial

## 99% Complete Version

For a nearly complete version, include the following files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`

This provides every piece of code needed up until 2:18:27 in the tutorial. You will need to manually add the `IEnumerator PlayAgain()` function.

## Bare Minimum Version

For a bare minimum version, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`

This provides every piece of code needed up until 0:51:32 in the tutorial, covering the frogger movement section, which is the hardest part of implementing the new input system.
