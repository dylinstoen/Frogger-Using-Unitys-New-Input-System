# Convert this [Frogger tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxlxZ5q__Tc&t) code to use Unitys new Input System

## Bare Minimum Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Bare Minimum Setup" folder for a bare minimum version, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger (Bare Minimum).cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`

This is a 10% completed version of Frogger. It provides every piece of code needed up until [0:51:32](https://youtu.be/GxlxZ5q__Tc?si=IwRe5YcFsOCC25dQ&t=3082) in the tutorial, covering the frogger movement section. Takes little to no manual setup just drag and drop and it should work.

## Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Mostly Completed Tutorial Setup" folder for a nearly complete version, include the following files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`
- `MoveCycle.cs` or `MoveCycle (Odin Serializer).cs` if you have the `Odin Serializer` add-on installed

This is a 90% completed version of Frogger. It provides every piece of code needed up until [2:18:27](https://youtu.be/GxlxZ5q__Tc?si=k-xLhMrlN-F8yW6h&t=8307) in the tutorial. Takes a little manual setup but nothing outside the tutorial.

## Beyond the Tutorial Setup

Drag and Drop all of the files inside the "Beyond the Tutorial Setup" folder for a version which seperates the input and logic into seperate scripts, include these files in your project:

- `Frogger.cs`
- `GameManager.cs`
- `Home.cs`
- `InputManager.cs`
- `MoveCycle.cs`
- `PlayerControls.cs`
- `PlayerControls.inputactions`
- `StatsGUIStyle.uss`
- `StatsGUIVisualTree.uxml`
- `PanelSettings.asset`
- `8-bit Arcade In.ttf`
- `MoveCycle.cs` or `MoveCycle (Odin Serializer).cs` if you have the `Odin Serializer` add-on installed

This is a 100% completed version of Frogger but I spent a little extra time refactoring the code. Requires `UI Toolkit` and it takes quite a bit of manual work to get setup, it also requires knoweldge on Unitys new `UI Toolkit` to get fully setup.
